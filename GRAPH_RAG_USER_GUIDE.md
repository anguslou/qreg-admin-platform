## Best Practices

### Exploration Workflow

1. **Start with Overview**: Use default 3D view to get general sense of relationships
2. **Apply Filters**: Focus on specific regulatory areas using type filters
3. **Search for Specifics**: Use text search to find particular regulations or entities
4. **Analyze Connections**: Select nodes to understand their regulatory relationships
5. **Export Insights**: Save relevant data for reports or further analysis

### Performance Tips

- **Large Graphs**: Use filters to reduce visual complexity
- **Smooth Navigation**: Allow animations to complete before new interactions
- **Mobile Usage**: Use pinch-to-zoom and tap interactions for best experience
- **VR Mode**: Ensure stable VR setup before enabling VR mode

### Analysis Strategies

**Regulatory Impact Assessment**
1. Search for specific regulation (e.g., "SFC Circular 2025/145")
2. Examine connected entities
3. Use shortest path to understand compliance chains
4. Export findings for compliance documentation

**Market Structure Analysis**
1. Filter for "Exchanges" and "Stablecoins"
2. Identify cluster patterns
3. Analyze regulatory coverage gaps
4. Generate network metrics report

**Compliance Mapping**
1. Select major exchanges or stablecoins
2. Trace regulatory requirements using connections
3. Identify compliance dependencies
4. Export complete regulatory pathway

## FAQ

**Q: Can I save my analysis or annotations?**
A: Currently, you can export graph data, but saved analyses are not persistent. Future versions may include save/load functionality.

**Q: How often is the graph data updated?**
A: The graph displays current regulatory relationships. Data updates occur when new regulations or entities are added to the QReg system.

**Q: Can I create custom node types or relationships?**
A: The current version displays predefined regulatory relationships. Custom relationship creation may be available in future releases.

**Q: Is there a limit to graph size?**
A: The system handles up to 1000 nodes efficiently. Larger graphs may require filtering for optimal performance.

**Q: Can multiple users collaborate on graph analysis?**
A: Currently single-user only. Multi-user collaboration features are under consideration for future development.
